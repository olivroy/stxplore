The goal of stxplore is to explore spatio-temporal data. It is not a modelling tool. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of stxplore from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sevvandi/stxplore")
```

## The making of stxplore
In 2017,  Chris Wikle and Petra Kunhert taught a short course titled *An Introduction to Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data*.  The course was based on two books:

1. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data by Noel Cressie and Christopher K. Wikle
2. Spatio-Temporal Statistics with R by Christopher K. Wikle, Andrew Zammit-Mangion and Noel Cressie

The course heavily used the materials from **Spatio-Temporal Statistics with R**. The code used in the book is contained in the R package **STRbook**.  Chris Wikle and Petra Kunhert thanked/acknowledged Andrew Zammit-Mangion in multiple places in their slides for the teaching course. 

There had been some discussions in making a separate package for spatio-temporal exploration. Even though there are many packages for spatio-temporal modelling, exploration is rarely given the spotlight. Many years later, Petra mentioned this to me and I've been involved in making it a reality.
